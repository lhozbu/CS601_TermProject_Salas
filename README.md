## Testing
Done in the following browsers:

2. Chrome
3. Chromium
4. Edge
5. Firefox Android
6. Chrome Android

## Known issues
1. In the image gallery, depending on the size of the image, when zooming in the image could get cut off.  The solution for it is to change the size of the image and re-compress it, however due limitations in time it was not possible to fix.

## Wish list 
1. Release animations.
2. More content.
3. Changing theme dynamically.
4. Page transition animation.
5. Font icons.
6. User tracker.
