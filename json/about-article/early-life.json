    "I was born in Costa Rica in the year of 1986. I'm part of a family of 3, 2 women and myself. I'm 20 years apart from my 2 sisters, which in fact feels like having 3 moms. One of my sisters is a MBA with a specialization in Taxation, the other one is a MD with specialization in Epidemiology. My father was a police officer, and part of the military police in my country when it existed, and later in his life a private investigator, he passed away in 2019. My mom is a house wife, currently living in Costa Rica.",
    "Asthma got me when I was very young. As a consequence of this, my parents made me to start doing sports very young. Swimming and Basketball have been part of my life all the time. Formal swimming requires a high control of the respiration, therefore strengthening the lungs. Basketball is a high cardio sport that requires you to keep running, making you able to control your respiration, concentrate and increase the stamina.",
    "Since very young I've taken guitar lessons for classical method. Playing an instrument activates parts of your brain you normally don't activate constantly, forcing it to create more neural connections and improving your thinking and how to resolve issues. Also helps you with the fine motor skills.",
    "All my life I've been interested in videogames, computers, software, making a hello world and in the late 90's I made my first web page. In fact, my contact with other languages was done early in my life through video games."
