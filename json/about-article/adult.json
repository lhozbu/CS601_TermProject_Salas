    "In 2012 I met my Jessica. She is an Interior Decorator that at the time had a company in Costa Rica called Lazo Decorations, which specialized in Christmas decorations for malls, but also did weddings, floral arrangements, theme parties and much more.",
    "By 2014, I already worked for 3 different companies, which I'm very thankful for all the experience I got from them. I had to move in order to be able to grow and find what I really liked.",
    "In the year 2015 I started to work at Vicor via the outsourcing company called EX2. A year after, I got the opportunity to transfer into the Computer Integrated Manufacturing department, which is a specialized in robotics integration. I found it fascinating because I was able to explore machinery, manufacturing processes and standards, industry protocols, get into high volume multi-threaded environments that require high performance.",
    "At the beginning of the year 2017 I got the offer of migrating to USA patrocinated by Vicor, having the Green Card process. The decision was very straight forward because I was enjoying my job a lot (still do). So, at that point Jessican and I decided to marry and do the processes together as a couple.",
    "In the year 2018 we adopted Ragnar the male Himalayan cat. At beginning of the year 2019 we adopted Daenerys the female Persian cat so she can accompany Ragnar in life. By 2019 we got our Green Card's approved and we moved to USA to start a new life from scratch, with only what we can carry and with our cats, we started a new adventure, kind of reminds me when you get access to the open world map in an RPG videogame."
