    "In the year 2009, when I was about to graduate from the University, I acquired a weird bacterial decease called Brucellosis. After hundreds of visits to doctors and several tests, there wasn't much progress in the diagnosis. I even was told that I was faking, that I had probably a mental breakdown. Unfortunately, my sister, the MD, was outside the country with little to no communication.",
    "I took the decision to take the matters in my hand. So based on the results of the tests that I had I started to read medical books and learn about how to diagnose myself, I had literature at hand anyways. I found in one text that there is a test called the antigen test. It requires blood from cow or sheep to find specific types of bacteria, especially those bacteria that affect different animals but all humans. I found that most laboratories on Costa Rica used cow blood and only one used sheep blood. I repeated the test in the one that used sheep blood and it came back positive for Brucellosis. With the diagnosis ready a MD doctor with speciality on Infectious Diseases was able to treat me."
